            <div class="section-body">We first plot every U.S.-related airplane incident that has an available
                location. Using this kind of view, we can easily gather specific information about each incident by
                hovering. However, because the circles have overlap, this kind of view makes it difficult to see where
                incidents are concentrated.</div>

        <section class="step">
            <div class="title">Heat Maps</div>
            <div class="section-body">By changing these incident circles into heat circles, we can see where
                incidents are most concentrated. However, because of the overlap, it is no longer useful to provide an
                information tooltip.</div>
